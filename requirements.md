Project Proposal
AttackSim: Simulated threats. Real awareness.
 

    Project Goal:

AttackSim: An Interactive Platform for Security Awareness and Detection Training
   Project Description (more depth):

To build an educational tool that simulates real-world cyberattacks (like phishing, malicious links, fake login pages), enabling users to experience and learn how to detect and respond to threats in a controlled and safe environment. Admins can configure attack scenarios, schedule delivery, and monitor results.

   Project Schedule

   Week 1

 

Research common real-world attack vectors (email phishing, fake logins, credential harvesting, etc.)

Finalise core features and draft UI wireframes

Begin setting up development environment

       Week 2

Implement a basic login spoofing attack page and test it locally

Design admin interface mockup

Prepare proposal blog with justification, examples, and ethical considerations

       Week 3

Add support for fake email delivery with custom messages

Build backend to track user interactions and show results

Start testing with mock users (myself and friends)

Note: Project Proposal Due Monday 4PM with Week 2 Portfolio

      Week 4

Implement “you’ve been hacked” pop-up + safety message logic

Add phishing scenario variations (bank, university, social media, etc.)

Conduct basic usability tests

      Week 5

Polish admin interface (select targets, schedule attacks)

Add an analytics dashboard to show detection stats per user

Collect feedback and adjust based on issues found

      Week 6   

-- Flexibility Week --

 

 Week 7

Run the tool with a few testers, gather reflection data (what worked, what didn’t)

Write documentation on lessons learned and user feedback

Start the final report draft

 

Week 8

Final polish and bug fixes

Finalise and submit the project report, including reflection and technical explanation

Prepare a walkthrough video or demo if required

Note: Final Report Deliverable Due Friday 4PM 25th July

   Project Deliverables/Outcomes:   

 

A working prototype of AttackSim with:

At least 3 different attack simulations (phishing email, fake website login, suspicious link)

Admin panel for controlling scenarios

Logs of interactions for post-analysis

Educational messages after the simulation

Technical report detailing:

System architecture

Attack logic and implementation

Reflections on what worked, what didn’t

Ethical concerns and mitigation (e.g., how to avoid harm)

User feedback from test runs

Maybe: open-source GitHub repository with attribution and license

 

Extra Notes:
Security focus: It demonstrates an understanding of social engineering, phishing, detection techniques, user behaviour, and secure practices.

Teaching element: While it’s technical, it’s also designed to educate others through interaction.

Ethical consideration: Ensure all tests are consensual, local only (not public web/email spam), and include clear messages and opt-outs.
