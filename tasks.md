# AttackSim Project Tasks

## Core Development Tasks

### 🔍 Research & Planning
- [ ] Research common real-world attack vectors (email phishing, fake logins, credential harvesting, social engineering techniques)
- [ ] Design system architecture and technical stack (frontend, backend, database, deployment)
- [ ] Create UI wireframes for admin panel, attack simulations, and user interface

### 🏗️ Infrastructure & Setup
- [ ] Set up development environment and project structure
- [ ] Implement user authentication and session management system
- [ ] Create comprehensive logging system for post-analysis and reporting
- [ ] Set up deployment configuration and environment setup scripts

### 👤 User Interface & Admin Panel
- [ ] Build admin panel for configuring and managing attack scenarios
- [ ] Create analytics dashboard showing detection stats and user performance
- [ ] Add ability for admins to schedule attack scenarios for specific users/groups

### 🎯 Attack Simulations
- [ ] Implement phishing email simulation with customizable templates
- [ ] Create fake login page simulations (bank, university, social media variants)
- [ ] Implement suspicious/malicious link detection simulation

### 📊 Backend & Data Management
- [ ] Build backend system to track user interactions and responses
- [ ] Build tracking system for monitoring user behavior during simulations

### 🎓 Educational Components
- [ ] Implement educational pop-ups and safety messages after simulations
- [ ] Create learning materials and awareness content

### 🛡️ Security & Ethics
- [ ] Implement consent and opt-out mechanisms for ethical compliance
- [ ] Perform security review to ensure the platform itself is secure

### 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance
- [ ] Conduct usability testing with mock users and gather feedback
- [ ] Perform final testing, bug fixes, and performance optimization

### 📚 Documentation & Delivery
- [ ] Write technical documentation including API docs and user guides
- [ ] Prepare final project report with architecture and reflections
- [ ] Create demo materials and walkthrough content

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend
- User-friendly interface for simulations
- Admin dashboard for scenario management
- Analytics and reporting interface
- Responsive design for multiple devices

### Backend
- RESTful API for admin operations
- Database for user data, scenarios, and results
- Email delivery system for phishing simulations
- Real-time tracking and analytics

### Security Considerations
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Data encryption and privacy protection
- Audit logging for all admin actions
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

## Success Criteria
- [ ] At least 3 different attack simulation types working
- [ ] Complete admin panel with scenario management
- [ ] Analytics dashboard with meaningful metrics
- [ ] Educational content delivery system
- [ ] Comprehensive logging and reporting
- [ ] Ethical safeguards and consent mechanisms
- [ ] Technical documentation and user guides
- [ ] Successfully tested with real users

## Notes
- Ensure all testing is consensual and local only
- Include clear opt-out mechanisms throughout
- Focus on educational value over attack sophistication
- Consider open-source release with proper attribution
